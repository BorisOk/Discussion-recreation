## Spring-Boot-Project
- ***In the project, I demonstrated:** (Registration and entrance of a user. Added an administrator who can see a list of users and who can give administrator rights and stylized the pages a little. (Using Bootstrap)). Added account activation by sending mail to the user.*
- ***When writing it took:** String Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Html, CSS, PostgreSQL, originally Mustache templating engine later Freemarker, Bootstrap, 
connected OpenAPI (swagger) for ease of testing (very cool thing).*
- ***Idea:** The idea came to do it all on the topic of travel. So that all authorized users can share their travel story. We could read about the travels of other users.
And among all the stories, using the search, you can find travel stories from a specific country. I think I did it well.*
- ***The project is still being finalized***
