## Sprig Security. (User authorization)
- ***In the project, I demonstrated:** (User authorization and slightly styled the main page that the user gets to when authorizing. (A little using HTML and mainly CSS))*
- ***When writing it took:** String Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, Html, CSS, PostgreSQL,
connected OpenAPI (swagger) for ease of testing (very cool thing).
The idea came to do it all on the topic of travel. So that all authorized users can share their travel story. We could read about the travels of other users.
And among all the stories, using the search, you can find travel stories from a specific country. I think I did it well.*
